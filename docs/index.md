# Welcome to the WildBeast documentation!

## What is WildBeast?

WildBeast is a multifunction Discord bot system intended to be able to perform various tasks, ranging from easy server moderation (Kick, ban) to having fun (8ball, meme generation, music playback) in your Discord server. It has an extensive per-server customization system with various settings. For people interested in running a WildBeast instance themselves, there is even a sort of API for making your own commands.

## Brief history

WildBeast was originally written by 3 avid coders in 2015. Since then many devs have come and gone, years have rolled and the bot has continuously matured. It's currently being constantly developed and improved by a multinational team of 11 developers, moderators and other personnel at the time of writing. Check out the team [here](http://thesharks.xyz/team.html)!

!!! tip
    For those interested in the technical bits, WildBeast is written in JavaScript utilizing Node.js. It uses the `discordie` library to interact with the Discord API.
