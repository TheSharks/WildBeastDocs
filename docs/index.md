## What is WildBeast?

WildBeast is a multifunction Discord bot system intended to be able to perform various tasks, ranging from easy server moderation (Kick, ban) to having fun (8ball, meme generation, music playback) in your Discord server. It has an extensive per-server customization system with various settings. For people interested in running a WildBeast instance themselves, there is even a sort of API for making your own commands.

## Brief history

WildBeast was originally written by 3 avid coders in 2015. Since then many devs have come and gone, years have rolled by and the bot has continuously matured. It's currently being constantly developed and improved by a multinational team of freelance and hobbyist developers.

## Version 6

The new version of WildBeast, version 6 (Which this documentation targets) has received considerable overhauls - most noticeably under the hood. If you are running a WB version previous to v6, **do not attempt to update your existing instance.** Read the [migrating](migrating.md) page to find out more.

## Main features

These features are available in every WildBeast instance, including our official WildBot!
