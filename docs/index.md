#Welcome to the WildBeast documentation!
WildBeast is a multifunction Discord bot intended to be able to perform various tasks, ranging from easy server moderation (Kick, ban) to having fun (8Ball etc.) in your Discord server. All created with customizability and ease of use in mind.

##General information
WildBeast was originally written by [SteamingMutt](https://github.com/SteamingMutt) "Dougley", [Mirrorbreak](https://github.com/Mirrorbreak) "Mirrow" and Perpetucake. Since then it has became one of the more widely used Discord bots, with over 35000 servers and counting only on the official WildBot.

It is written in JavaScript using the Node.js runtime, and with the Discordie library.

##Main features
These features are available in every WildBeast instance, including our official WildBot!

- Music streaming from YouTube, SoundCloud etc.
- Classy insults
- Dank meme generation system with your own parameters
- Useful advice
- Moderation commands
- NSFW images via e621 and rule34
- Server utilities (Welcome messages, server and user info etc.)
- High level of customization (Changing messages on a per-server basis, permission level system)

In addition, WildBeast has its very own command building syntax which is very easy to start making new commands with. You can see more of this over at [the Custom Commands page](custom_commands.md).

##Selfhosting
We provide very extensive guides on installing WildBeast over here on the wiki, written by our trusty paperworker LWTechGaming. Currently we support installation on Windows and Ubuntu systems. Docker guides are on their way.
