This is the command reference for WildBeast. You can find more elaborative information here on each of the commands currently implemented.
  
If you have need for any further info, you can send the message `{prefix}help <command>` to the bot to get info about timeouts and so forth. For lengthier explanations on the usage of the commands, check out #le-guide in [WildBot's Territory](https://discord.gg/0cFoiR5QVh5LZlQO).
  
The prefix is not specified in this reference. You have to apply your own prefix to the commands. If you don't know the prefix, type `@<botname> prefix` in the server you're using.

##Customize command
The customize command is a multifaceted command that needs its own table to illustrate how it works.
  
The customize command makes changes to the server-specific database of WildBeast. It allows you to set a custom member join announcement and tweak some responses. You need a permission level of 3 to use the customize command.   

Name | Description | Usage | Note 
---- | ----------- | ----- | ----- 
customize | Base command for the customizer. | customize `<method>` `<parameter/content>` | See below for the methods.
prefix | Change the command prefix. Enclose the prefix in double quotes. | customize prefix "`<prefix>` | 
permissions | Change response given when users don't have permissions to execute a command. | customize permissions `<message>` | 
timeout | Change response given when a command is still on cooldown. | customize timeout `<message>` | 
welcoming| Changes whether the bot should send a welcome message when a new member joins. | customize welcoming `<off/channel/private>` | 
welcome | Changes the welcome message specified above. | customize welcome `<message>` | 
nsfw | Change the response given when a channel doesn't have NSFW commands allowed. | customize nsfw `<message>` | 

All commands except for the option-based ones (`welcoming` and `prefix`) support certain variables in the messages. The variables start with `%` and are the following.

Variable | Description | Usable responses 
-------- | ----------- | ---------------- 
user | Username of the user that triggered the response. | All 
server | Name of the server. | All 
channel | Name of the channel the response was triggered in. | All except `welcome` 
timeout | Amount of seconds the command is on cooldown. | Only `timeout`
ulevel | Short of user level, the user's current permission level. | Only `permissions` 
nlevel | Short of need level, permission level required to execute the command. | Only `permissions`
